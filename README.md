Personal Project Revisiting an Unfinished High School Project

PROCESS
This project was initially an unfinished final unit project on Java created using Processing for my high school AP Computer Science and Principles class.
I decided to revisit the project and finally work toward finishing it, aiming to practice my Java skills.

This is an ongoing personal project and is still currently unfinished.
